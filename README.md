## Introduction: 
<p>We have proposed a new and more efficient technique of antenna design utilising multiple ML models , which will solve the disadvantages of the traditional method, which is quite time consuming and generally becomes more difficult as design parameters rise. Using these strategies, the number of HFSS simulations required is reduced by a significant amount, saving us a significant amount of time. </p>

### ML models used:

  - KNN
  - XG Boost
  - Decision tree
  - Random forest
  - Artificial neural network
  - Source Difference KBNN
  - Prior Knowledge Input KBNN
